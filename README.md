# Fantasy Name Generator
A simple randomly generated Fantasy name app for Amazon Alexa

# How it was made:
- This Amazon Alexa Skill was made using the Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) templates and website
  -https://developer.amazon.com/alexa
  
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) Lambda Function was also used. The lambda_function.py module is what was written in my lambda function
  -That is where the main functionality of the skill comes from. The ASK provides a simple UI to create Intents (what the alexa user actually says to trigger different events in your program) in the required JSON code. The AWS Lambda module was able to written in Python, but to actually have Alexa say something, you'd need to convert the strings into JSON. You can find these functions on any of the skill templates though, and they are very straight-forward
